								<p><em>Cantiga</em> is a membership management and collaboration system. It helps you managing
								the projects run by your non-profit organization, and your members - working on them. It works
								for you, if your project is small, limited to an area of a town or a city, where everyone know
								one another personally. They now have a platform to collaborate remotely, keep on what is going
								on and what to do. It also works for you, as your project grows and reaches new areas. You get
								a tool, where leaders of the local editions can work together, and you have a system to track
								the progress, and communicate with them.</p>

								<h2>Mission</h2>
								
								<p><em>Our mission is to help non-profit organizations reach their goals. We do this by providing a
								high-quality, open-source platform that enables the organizations manage, collaborate and communicate
								seamlessly on their distributed projects. We want our platform to scale as the projects grow,
								by implementing the best engineering and collaboration practices.</em></p>

								<h2>Case studies</h2>
								
								<p><strong><a href="http://www.edk.org.pl/">Extreme Way of the Cross</a></strong> is a Polish Christian
								project that originated in 2009 in Kraków. Over years, it attracted hundreds of thousands of people in
								entire country, and abroad, to walk 40 kilometers at night through forests, bogs and mountains to
								practice the old, traditional Way of the Cross devotion. The project is a joint work of hundreds of local
								leaders who run their own local editions in cooperation with central team, providing a know-how and standarized
								way of running the event.</p>
								
								<p>As the project grew, the communication between the leaders and the team was becoming more and more
								challenging. At some point, it started being unmanageable via just e-mails and telephones. To solve
								this problem, the IT team decided to write a collaboration platform to track the progress, on-line courses,
								and allow the leaders managing the event on their own, and running the participant registration. Over
								two years of working with the users and learning what they actually need, the system became the
								project which is now known as <strong>Cantiga</strong>.</p>
								
								<p>In 2016 edition, Extreme Way of the Cross was run in 115 areas in Poland, Czech Republic, 
								Great Britain, Norway, Switzerland and United States of America. Cantiga allowed the local leaders
								to manage their areas, publish the routes on the project website, and run the participant registration.
								The central team could track the progress, control the key milestones and provide on-line introductory
								courses to the idea and key skills required to prepare a route. <em>The project of such a scale would
								be impossible to run without this system, it saved us a lot of time</em>, said collectively the
								coordinators responsible for working with the leaders. Since the very beginning, Cantiga was thought
								to become a general-purpose project, and now this moment has happened.</p>

								<h2>Team</h2>
								
								<p>The project is led by <strong>Tomasz Jędrzejewski</strong> who designed and coded the core
								functionality. He works as a professional Java programmer, designing mission-critical public
								safety systems and leading trainings and workshops about Java, and Git. In the past, he was a
								professional PHP programmer, and still uses this language for smaller projects. Personally, he's
								a fan of long-distance walks and a volunteer in Extreme Way of the Cross project. You can catch
								him up at his <a href="http://techvival.zyxist.com">Techvival</a> programming blog, and his
								travel blog <a href="http://www.zyxist.com/">dzienniki zyxowe</a> (Polish only).</p>
								
								<p><strong>Piotrek Żak</strong> was the original author of the idea of creating such a platform,
								and provided some early programming. He supports the project in the UI/UX area, and by processing
								user feedback. He works as a manager for one of the biggest Polish IT companies, and is one of
								the leaders of Extreme Way of the Cross.</p>
