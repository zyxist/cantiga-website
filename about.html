								<p><em>Cantiga</em> is a membership management and collaboration system. It helps your non-profit
								organization managing your projects, and the volunteers - collaborating on them. It works for you,
								if your project is small, limited to an area of a single town or city, where everyone knows one
								another personally. Now they have a platform to collaborate remotely and track the project progress.
								It also works for you, as your project grows and expands into new areas. You get a tool, where
								local leaders from different cities can work together, and you always know what is going on.</p>

								<h2>Mission</h2>
								
								<p><em>Our mission is to help non-profit organizations run their projects. We do this by providing
								a high-quality, open-source platform that enables the organizations manage, collaborate and communicate
								seamlessly on their projects. We want our platform to scale as the projects grow,
								by implementing the best engineering and collaboration practices.</em></p>

								<h2>Case studies</h2>
								
								<p><strong><a href="http://www.edk.org.pl/">Extreme Way of the Cross</a></strong> is a project that
								started in 2009 in Kraków. Over years, it attracted hundreds of thousands of people in Poland, Great
								Britain, Norway, Switzerland, USA, and other countries, to walk 40 kilometers at night through forests,
								bogs and mountains to practice the old, traditional Way of the Cross devotion. It even reached as remote
								areas, as Svalbard and Antarctica. The project is a joint work of hundreds of local leaders who run
								their own local editions in cooperation with central team which provides the know-how and the standards
								how the event should look like.</p>
								
								<p>Extreme Way of the Cross uses Cantiga for the registration of new areas, and managing them. Area
								leaders can use the provided tools to publish their routes on the project website, and run the registration
								of participants. Cantiga is also a tool for tracking the project progress and training new leaders
								through the on-line course module.</p>

								<h2>Team</h2>
								
								<p>The project is led by <strong>Tomasz Jędrzejewski</strong> who designed and coded the core
								functionality. He works as a professional Java programmer, designing mission-critical public
								safety systems and leading trainings and workshops about Java, and Git. In the past, he was a
								professional PHP programmer, and still uses this language for personal projects. Personally, he's
								a fan of long-distance walks. You can catch him up at his Polish travel blog 
								<a href="http://www.zyxist.com/">dzienniki zyxowe</a> (Polish only).</p>
								
								<p><strong>Piotrek Żak</strong> was the original author of the idea of creating such a platform,
								and provided some early programming. He supports the project in the UI/UX area, and by processing
								user feedback. He works as a manager for one of the biggest Polish IT companies, and is one of
								the leaders of Extreme Way of the Cross.</p>
