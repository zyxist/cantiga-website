                                        <h3>Projects, groups and areas</h3>
                                        <p>Cantiga supports multiple projects, which can be further divided into
                                        groups and areas. Each of it has its own intranet workspace, where the members
                                        can meet and work. Leaders can request creating the new areas, which then
                                        undergo a moderation process before being approved for the project. This model
                                        works for small projects, and allows them growing in the future to support even
                                        country-wide projects.</p>
