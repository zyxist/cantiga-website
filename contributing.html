                                        GitHub</a>, and label it with <tt>bug</tt> label. Please remember to describe the scenario to reproduce the problem.</p>

                                        <p>You can request new features on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cantiga-project-users">project discussion list</a>. We appreciate new ideas and features, however - 
                                        remember that the requested feature should be useful for everyone. It may take some time until
                                        we start the actual work, but you can speed it up by trying to develop the feature yourself.</p>
